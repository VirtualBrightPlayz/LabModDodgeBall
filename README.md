Fight other Class-D in a closed room to the death!

The Catch:
- Everyone spawns with 3 Bottles of Painkillers
- Everyone spawns with 3 of SCP-018
- After 45 seconds, everyone gets a USP and ammo
- After 60 seconds, the round will force restart

## Admin
 There is only one command, `.dodgeball`
 
 Run it in the game console, and the permission `RoundEvents` is required for it to toggle
 
 If it works, it will print `dodgeball=<true|false>`
